## Inspiration
As college students, we often shop with our roommates and have to split costs. It can become a hassle, and it's tedious and cumbersome to calculate how much everyone owes. For that reason, we came up with an easy and quick way for everyone to streamline expense splitting.

## What it does
Payback simplifies expense splitting for groups. Users can snap a picture of the receipt, invite friends to the group, and effortlessly allocate expenses. No more manual calculations or confusionâ€”just a hassle-free solution for sharing costs.

## How we built it
We used React Native for the frontend, Firebase for backend services, Flask as the backend framework, PyTesseract for image text recognition, GitHub for version control, and PyTorch for additional image processing. This combination allowed us to create a robust, cross-platform app with powerful image recognition capabilities.

## Challenges we ran into
We had issues with the image text recognition using PyTesseract, and it took a lot of trial and error to find a configuration that worked. We also encountered challenges in preprocessing the images for accurate recognition. Integrating the frontend with the backend and image recognition posed another challenge, requiring extensive effort to ensure seamless functionality.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud to have created a user-friendly app that addresses a common pain point for many, making expense splitting among friends a smooth and enjoyable experience. Achieving a seamless integration of features is an accomplishment we celebrate.

## What we learned
Developing Payback taught us valuable lessons in user interface design, receipt processing algorithms, and effective teamwork. We gained insights into the importance of user feedback and iterative development.

## What's Next for Payback
Looking ahead, we plan to enhance Payback by incorporating additional features based on user feedback. We aim to make it the go-to app for effortless expense management, continually refining and expanding its capabilities.
